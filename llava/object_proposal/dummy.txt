If you want to format the output such that each numbered item contains only one object, you can structure your prompt to specify this clearly. Hereâ€™s how you can phrase your prompt:

### Example Prompt:

"Please list the following items in the format: 1. object1 2. object2 3. object3:

- Object1
- Object2
- Object3"

### Example Output:

1. Object1
2. Object2
3. Object3

### Additional Tips:

1. **Specify the Format Clearly:**
   Make sure to explicitly state that each numbered item should contain only one object.

2. **Use Numbering in Your Prompt:**
   You can use a numbered list in your prompt to show the desired output structure.

3. **Provide an Example:**
   Including an example can help the model understand exactly how you want the list to look.

### Full Example:

To make it even clearer, here's a more detailed example prompt:

"Please list the items in the following format: 1. object1 2. object2 3. object3. For example:

- Apple
- Banana
- Cherry

The output should be:
1. Apple
2. Banana
3. Cherry

Now, list these items:

- Dog
- Cat
- Bird"

The model should then provide the output in the desired format:

1. Dog
2. Cat
3. Bird

By following these guidelines, you can guide the LLM to produce outputs in the specific format you need.
