<image>\nUSER:\n
You are the robot which is equipped with wheels and a manipulator arm, and the given image represents the environment you are observing.\n

you got the task `{task}`, identify the objects that could be involved.\n
Available objects are `{avail_obj}`\n

Can you provide a concise, step-by-step plan for a robot to complete the following task using only the following action functions: "find", "pick_up", "go_to", "put_down", and "done"?
The explanation of the action functions are as follow:
	def go_to(coordinate: string):
		# navigate robot base to location coordinates
		# location can be object, location's, or description's coordinate

	def find(object: string):
		# find object location coordinate using camera equipped in robot arm
		return ([x, y, z] float coordinate of object)
		
	def pick_up(what_to: string):
		# move robot arm to 'what_to' coordinate and grasp
		
	def put_down(where_to: string):
		# move robot arm to 'where_to' coordinate and release 

	def done : terminate when the plans are done or plan is nothing


First, Please include an explanation before listing the steps, detailing what the robot should do overall with format 
Second, list only the essential steps using only the following action functions: ["find", "pick_up", "go_to", "put_down"] to complete the task, and make sure to end with "done" when the task is complete.
Output should follow the format:\n
Explanation:\n overall plan

Once the robot has found the coffee cup, it should "go_to" the coffee cup's location. Pick up the cup using its manipulator arm from the table or counter. Next, "find" the trash can's location and "go_to" the trash can. After reaching the trash can, the robot should "put_down" the coffee cup inside the trash can. Finally, the robot should confirm that the task is complete by saying "done".
